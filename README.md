# Shopify CSharp Example
 A project used to test the shopify API via C#, using ShopifySharp as the main library

## About:

This project was an attempt as utilizing the Shipify API through .NET using a library called ShopifySharp, created by nozzlegear: https://github.com/nozzlegear/ShopifySharp.

This project has been uploaded so i can easily show off the source code. I'm not going to go into great detail in how to get it setup on your end, as it requires a database, a url forwarder, and several fine-tuning aspects within the code itself to point to these features. It's simply here for access, and I will show examples of the project working locally.

This API will create a webpage using the Shopify API, connected via ShopifySharp, which has a useful instruction manual that you have to buy. The main issue with said instruction manual is that it is both outdated and incomplete, meanign several features and explanations were incorrect when attempting to debug various issues. 

Once the service is running, users will be able to make Shopify Accounts and subscribe to test services with test credit cards. The webpage can also display a database of orders, but the database must be filled in before hand, manually via SQL or through the Shopify service on their website. Again, this is just for testing services.
